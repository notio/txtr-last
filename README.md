#### TXTR ############################################

Txtr is a small SMS text adventure engine written in Python 2.7+. It uses an online application called Twilio to handle the SMS side of things. 
It was originally built at the end of 2013 to run the game Cat Quest. It was later built out into an online application to run the game Sext Adventure. 
This is the barebones local running non postgres desktop version. It has a minimal web layer. <br />

This is here AS IS. There is no guarantee its gonna work. But its pretty stable, so it should be ok.
