OK I will actually make a readme this time around. At some point. Yes I will.

### How do I get set up? ###

Note: You will need to make a twilio account over here: https://www.twilio.com/

Follow their guide and set up a number and account.

1) You will have to make your own keys.cfg file that will include your twilio account info / auth tokens
2) Download ngrok https://ngrok.com/ and follow the documentation on how to make a tunnel for your local port
3) run the app.py out of your terminal
4) BINGO you're texting the internet. That should be it for now.
